The subject matter of the course are divided into the following themes:<br><br>
<b>Theme 1 . Arbitrage, replicating portfolios, the single step binomial model.</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; Pricing of forwards options and implementing delta hedging with the single step binomial model. <br>
<b>Theme 2 . n-Step Binomial Trees. </b><br>
&emsp; &emsp; Pricing of forwards options and implementing delta hedging with the n-step binomial model. <br>
<b>Theme 3 . Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus.</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; Brownian Motion, Stochastic Calculus and Ito Calculus, Stochastic Differential Equations, Stochastic PDE's and Feynman Kac Method <br>
<b>Theme 4 . Continuous Models: Black-Scholes Theory</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; Log-Normal Stock model, Self-financing Strategies, Solving and modelling Black-Scholes PDE, Risk Neutral Strategies, Hedging and the Greeks. <br>
<b>Theme 5 . The Term Structure of Interest Rates and Bonds</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; Interest Rates, Forward Rates, Yield Curves, Market Price of Risk, Bond Price Models, Short Rate Models. <br>
<b>Theme 6 . Credit Risk</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; The Merton Modeland the Jarrow, Landow, Turnbull Model. <br><br>

<b>Spesific computational topics explored in Microsoft Excel:</b><br>
&emsp; &emsp; - Calibrating the (discrete) binomial model. We use the Cox-Ross-Rubenstein approach for our binomial tree model.<br>
&emsp; &emsp; - Using of market data to find implied volatilities.<br>
&emsp; &emsp; - Using implied volatilities together with the Black-Scholes formulae, binomial trees and spreadsheets to price various derivative securities.
